# floating-point-unit-with-VHDL
This unit does floating point operations.
It is almost compatible with IEEE 754 standard,
the difference is that denormal numbers flushed to zero in this design.
# floating point representation:
 It is a way of representing data that is similar to scientific notation.  
 for example:  
 *125*   is the same as  *1.25 10^2*
